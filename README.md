# Holt-Story
An amazing story about Holt
The day started out bad and got worse.
I wasn't thinking about the fire.
And I wasn't thinking about the gunshots coming through the window
I was trying to figure out how to get untied...
I could not get loose.
The door swung upon.
Twenty dogs ran in.
They then ran out immediately.
